Is about time to reinvigorate Chevereto!

I took some time to build our new foundations and you waited all this time. I'm glad, thanks for your support. It's payday!

Today I'm announcing a road map that will unveil V4.X releases and project updates for the years to come.

This is the first time for the project where we will be offering two editions as we will market V3 LTS for production systems while V4 will be our ahead release. This will enable us to offer two software products: One for production and another one for development previews.

## Chevereto V3.20: May 2021

Chevereto V3.20 (*coqueto*) culminates the project work within 2013-2021 and is the final version for Chevereto V3. It was about time to end V3 with a release this big, to close this chapter of the project the best way possible.

_Read [Chevereto V3.20 &#8220;coqueto&#8221; announcement](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/chevereto-v3-20-coqueto-announcement.13132/)._

This release features a user interface upgrade, support for containers, improved performance and reliability. Coqueto improves in everything required to mature Chevereto V3 and it will keep getting maintenance until **November 2022** to match with PHP 7.4 eol.

V3.20 was built on top of **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**. You will be able to run V3.20 based production systems until **April 2025**.

## Chevereto V4.0: September 2021

The release of Chevereto V4 (*macanudo*) will happen in September 2021 and it evolves from coqueto. Chevereto V4.0 will require PHP 8.0 and it will carry a significative development cycle.

_Read [Chevereto V4.0 &#8220;macanudo&#8221; announcement](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/chevereto-v4-0-macanudo-announcement.13188/)._

*Macanudo* will feature extended social login support and user based API. This is a huge change as it makes the default user interface exactly that: A default, enabling your users to use your Chevereto installation from any compatible API client.

## Chevereto V4 release cycle

All V4 releases will be named, released each 6 months. Chevereto V4.X updates will be about improving on everything and I'm confirming at most five revisions for this major version.
