> ðŸ‘‰ Check the all-new universal VPS provisioning [here](https://github.com/chevereto/vps).

Deploying Chevereto in VPS has become trivial for [Linode](https://chevereto.com/go/linode) and [Vultr](https://chevereto.com/go/vultr) customers thanks to their application marketplaces. This made the deployment process a joy compared with the all-manual labor alternative. Thanks to these folks and their vision, more people can easy self-host their own Chevereto.

But not all providers offer application marketplace or welcome our application for inclusion. Reasons vary, from offering PHP software all the way up for being a Chilean-based company.

*Â¡Pico con la wea!* We've released a universal [bash script](https://github.com/chevereto/vps) for deploying Chevereto in any VPS!

## Where it will work?

ðŸ¤— Everywhere!

Our system will work in any VPS offering Ubuntu 20.04 machines. To name a few:

* Linode ðŸ’–
* Vultr ðŸ’–
* Hostwinds
* AWS (EC2 / Lightsail)
* Google Cloud
* Netcup
* UpCloud
* Hetzner
* Hostinger
* OVH
* scaleway
* digitalocean
* And more...

Give a try and let us know how it works for you.

ðŸ˜˜ *Â¡Los queremos!*
