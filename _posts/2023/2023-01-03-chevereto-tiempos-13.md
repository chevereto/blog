### Semantics

Chevereto v4.0.6 introduces support for custom content semantics, which enables to configure the terms used for all content labels including images, albums, categories and more.

![Semantics listing](/photos/2023/4.0.6/semantics-listing.jpg)

For example, if you want to offer goods with Chevereto you could change "Album" to "Product", "Categories" to "Brands" and "Users" to "Clients". If you are using Chevereto for managing media assets you could change "Images" to "Samples" or "Photos". There's no limits, you define the context.

With semantics you can now bend Chevereto to wrap your content and context the exact way you want, providing a more engaging experience for your users.

### Call-to-action buttons

Chevereto v4.0.6 introduces customizable call-to-action (CTA) buttons for albums, which enables to create extra buttons that will be shown at the album view and when viewing images belonging-to.

With this addition you can now add custom actions pointing to a purchase link, messenger contact, send an email, download a file, book calendar, call a number and more.

For custom CTA you can use Font Awesome icons or Emoji and point to any [href](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#attr-href) target. You can also change button priority by simply dragging them.

### Added support for RTL languages

There are great news for Arabic, Hebrew, Persian and all the right-to-left languages as Chevereto v4.0.6 greatly improves the user experience for these. User interface now looks the way it should be for users of these languages.

All margins, borders, padding and alignments have been revisited, the entire user interface is now RTL compatible in a degree never seen before.

### New profile display

User profile display has been improved and now the user avatar shows on center of the viewport. What we are seeking with this is to give top priority for the user at its profile page.
