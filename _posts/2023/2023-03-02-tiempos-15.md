This is the issue #15 of Chevereto Tiempos, the monthly curated recap for all-things Chevereto crafted by its own creator.

## 🚀 Chevereto v4.0.7

I'm happy to share that latest [v4.0.7](https://releases.chevereto.com/4.X/4.0/4.0.7.html) patch is doing great and I'm confident enough to consider this as the most stable release in `4.0` branch to date.

As v4.0.7 went this good I will extend the lifetime of this release for another month to see how it goes and to enjoy a few weeks of the slow pace of a well-earned stable label.
