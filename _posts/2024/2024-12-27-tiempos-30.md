## Recap of 2024

As we look back on 2024, it's been an exciting year filled with significant updates and new features for Chevereto. Here's a month-by-month recap of the major milestones and releases that have shaped Chevereto this year.

### December 2024

We [introduced Chevereto Lite](2024-12-08-hello-chevereto-lite.md), a new lightweight edition of Chevereto tailored for individuals and projects needing straightforward media hosting. Chevereto Lite offers essential features like multi-user support, moderation tools, and OAuth2 login providers, making it perfect for personal projects and small communities. It also introduces a flexible monthly subscription model, providing affordable and reliable media hosting without unnecessary complexities.

### October 2024

In October, we released [Chevereto v4.2](2024-10-24-chevereto-4.2.md), a significant update that introduced a versatile tagging system, configurable restrictions, enhanced storage handling, and AVIF image format support. These updates make it easier to organize, filter, and access your media, while also improving performance and the mobile experience. The release followed the [tags announcement](2024-04-04-tags.md) made in April 2024.

Chevereto v4.2 also includes improvements to the user interface, making it more intuitive and user-friendly. The new tagging system allows for better media categorization and searchability, while the configurable restrictions provide more control over user permissions and content visibility. Enhanced storage handling ensures efficient media management, and AVIF support offers better image compression and quality.

For a comprehensive overview and detailed insights into the new features, you can read the [Chevereto 4.2 development overview](https://rodolfoberrios.com/2024/11/20/chevereto-4-2/).

### April 2024

In April, we released [Chevereto v4.1](https://rodolfoberrios.com/2024/04/20/chevereto-4-1/), which introduced comprehensive video support, allowing users to upload, manage, and share videos alongside photos. This update followed the [video announcement](2024-03-19-video-support.md) made in March 2023, and includes features like video uploading, thumbnail generation, and playback capabilities, enhancing the overall media hosting experience.

### March 2024

We started offering a new [installation service](https://chevereto.com/panel/support) to help users set up their Chevereto instances quickly and easily. This service handles the technical aspects of installation, including server configuration and software setup, allowing users to focus on creating content and engaging with their audience.

Additionally, we added Chevereto to the [DigitalOcean Marketplace](https://chevereto.com/go/digitalocean), enabling users to deploy Chevereto instances with just a few clicks. This integration simplifies the deployment process, providing a seamless experience for users to get started with Chevereto on DigitalOcean's cloud infrastructure.

### February 2024

In February, we introduced a new [license key regeneration system](2024-02-03-license-key-regeneration.md) to simplify the process of managing your Chevereto license keys. This feature allows you to regenerate your license key if you lose access to it, ensuring uninterrupted use of Chevereto.

We also added Chevereto to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/chevereto/chevereto), making it easier to deploy and manage Chevereto instances using Docker containers. As of now, it has already achieved 10,000 pulls, adding to the 55,000 pulls from the [GHCR package](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto/pkgs/container/chevereto).

Chevereto was also added to the [Vultr marketplace](https://chevereto.com/go/vultr), enabling users to deploy Chevereto instances with a single click. This integration simplifies the setup and management of Chevereto on Vultr's cloud infrastructure.

Earlier this year, we transitioned to a [subscription model](2024-02-01-chevereto-subscription.md), providing access to Chevereto and its updates on a yearly basis. This change has significantly boosted development throughout the year, adding substantial features and improvements to Chevereto. We're excited to continue this journey in 2025, with more updates and enhancements to come.
