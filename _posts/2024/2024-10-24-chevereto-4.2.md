We are thrilled to announce the release of **Chevereto v4.2 (Regio)**, the most significant update of the year! After four months of hard work, this version brings a host of exciting features and enhancements to boost your Chevereto experience. From advanced tagging capabilities to performance improvements, v4.2 has something for everyone.

### Tagging System

In Chevereto v4.2, we've introduced a robust, flexible tagging system. You can now tag images and videos with multiple tags that support emojis, case-sensitivity, and a wide range of characters. Users can combine tags for powerful content filtering.

The system detects each user's most-used tags, building a personalized tag filtering system to streamline content discovery.

Admins and content managers can now add descriptions to tags, providing extra context. And with the option to auto-tag based on EXIF data (e.g., "Apple iPhone 6"), Chevereto makes organizing media even easier. Our enhanced tag autocomplete feature simplifies the process by offering instant tag suggestions as you type.

### New Limits & System Restrictions

While Chevereto offers flexibility, we know managing resources is critical. Version 4.2 introduces new system-level limits that allow you to fine-tune website performance. From managing the number of admins to setting limits on tags and storage, this update gives you full control.

### Session Handling and Storage Improvements

We've made session handling more configurable, allowing users to choose between file storage or Redis. External storage now supports MinIO path-style URLs, improved error handling, and the ability to remove external storage with queued deletions.

Asset storage can now be managed directly from the dashboard, simplifying configuration and operations.

### User Interface Upgrades

In Chevereto v4.2, the UI has been optimized with a new system palette that adapts to light or dark modes based on your device settings. Bulk selection handling is smoother, and multi-column menus now auto-adjust to fit your screen size, ensuring seamless browsing on any device.

### AVIF Support

We've added support for the **AVIF** image format, which offers superior compression and quality compared to JPEG and PNG. With AVIF, you can store more high-quality images without sacrificing performance.

### Performance Boosts

Chevereto v4.2 eliminates frequent local file re-checks, reducing disk read operations for faster file handling. We've also optimized the confirmation table with improved index definitions and introduced support for [bfcache](https://web.dev/articles/bfcache) for faster back-and-forth navigation.

Additionally, configurable HTTP caching and consolidated JavaScript files (now in `chevereto-all.js`) streamline performance and reduce server load.

### Security and Error Handling

Chevereto v4.2 enhances security by isolating system variables into a separate database table and ensuring HTML detection for all string settings.

Error handling is improved with more detailed request logging, helping to simplify debugging.

### New Features and Options

This version includes a host of new features like toggling guest album creation, customizable video routes, and an enhanced dark palette. We've also improved the "add to home" experience for iOS, making internal links behave more like a native app.

### API Enhancements

The API now allows for more precise content expiration control and auto-detects mime types, removing the need for manual input. We've added a new page to guide users in integrating Chevereto's API into their workflows, with personalized code snippets tailored to each user's setup.

### Mobile Optimizations

For mobile users, the v4.2 update brings a more efficient two-column layout for menus and an optimized Explore menu for quicker access. The "random" button has been replaced by a streamlined Explore button for a smoother experience.

### Explore More

We've expanded our **Explore** section with new listings like `/explore/images`, `/explore/tags`, and `/explore/albums`, making content discovery richer and more engaging.
