**Calling all moviemakers, memory-keepers, and product pioneers!** We've got some red-carpet-worthy news for you. A feature you've been clamoring for (and we've been hinting at) is finally target for release: **Chevereto with video support!**

**That's right!** The wait is over. You can ditch the third-party platforms and share your stunning video content directly on Chevereto.

We know this has been a highly anticipated feature, and while it was originally slated for v4.2.0, we just couldn't wait to get it into your hands.  Consider it a **thank you** for your unwavering support and patience.

## Lights, Camera, Chevereto!

Chevereto has always been the photo-sharing champion, and we're not going anywhere. But we see video as the next frontier for creative expression, and we want to be your one-stop shop for all your media needs.

**With upcoming support for video you can:**

* Share your favorite clips and memories.
* Showcase your products and services in a dynamic way.
* Create captivating presentations and tutorials.
* **And so much more!**

We've meticulously crafted video support to integrate flawlessly with Chevereto's existing photo-sharing experience. Uploading, managing, and displaying your videos will be a breeze. Get ready to be wowed by the stunning presentation in your listings!

**This is just the beginning.** For this initial release, we're focusing on MP4 compatibility. But fear not, future updates will bring support for a wider range of video formats, along with the ability to share audio, documents, and other media types.

## Next level sharing

We're incredibly excited to see the amazing video content you'll create and share on Chevereto. Stay tuned for the official v4.1.0 release, and prepare to unleash your creativity!
