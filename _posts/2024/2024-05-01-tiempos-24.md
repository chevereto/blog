Hey everyone, [Don Rodolfo](https://rodolfoberrios.com) here bringing you the hottest news from Chevereto in this month's Tiempos. There’s great things to share about Chevereto and with this issue of tiempos you won't miss any.

## Chevereto now with video support

On April 20 I [released Chevereto v4.1.0](https://releases.chevereto.com/4.X/4.1/4.1.0.html) “Pulento” with video support. One week later on April 27 I [released Chevereto v4.1.1](https://releases.chevereto.com/4.X/4.1/4.1.1.html) and on April 29 I [announced Chevereto v4.1.2](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/chevereto-v4-1-2-announcement.15428/). It has been a very productive April for the _Pulento_ release and it keeps getting better.

You can learn more about [Chevereto 4.1](https://rodolfoberrios.com/2024/04/20/chevereto-4-1/) on my blog where I disclose the inner workings and the effort required to build this amazing new release.

Besides [video support](./2024-03-19-video-support.md), this release also provides customizable theme fonts and starts delivering the [user-based API](./2024-02-02-user-based-api.md).

## Tags announcement

On April 4 I [announced Tags support](./2024-04-04-tags.md) for Chevereto v4.2.

With tags Chevereto will finally embrace fine-grained user driven context making it extremely useful for organizing all your media assets and more.
