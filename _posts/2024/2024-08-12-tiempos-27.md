## Chevereto.cloud

Our cloud service is in the final stages of preparation for public release. The system is a state-of-the-art, custom software solution, designed specifically by and for Chevereto.

The purpose of Chevereto cloud is to make Chevereto accessible to a broader audience while preserving the freedom and flexibility of self-hosting, which remains Chevereto's hallmark.

Chevereto Cloud operates on the same software as the self-hosted version, but without the hassle of managing a server. You can still use your own domain, storage, and other resources.

Chevereto cloud is expected to launch later this year. You can [pre-sign up](https://forms.gle/PTKDXEXL3Rca3LjV7) now.
