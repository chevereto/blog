We’re thrilled to unveil **Chevereto Lite**, the most affordable way to enjoy Chevereto’s reliable and private media hosting. This new edition is tailored for individuals and projects that need straightforward tools to host and share photos and videos without unnecessary complexities.

Chevereto Lite simplifies media hosting while preserving the quality and reliability Chevereto is known for, making it perfect for those seeking a budget-friendly option.

This marks the third edition under the Chevereto V4 ecosystem, enabling us to bring Chevereto to a broader audience than ever before.

## Monthly subscription

For the first time, Chevereto Lite introduces a **monthly subscription model**, giving customers greater flexibility and control. With no yearly commitment required, you can enjoy granular access to Chevereto Lite and use it according to your needs.

When your subscription ends, you’ll lose access to updates, but the software you’ve obtained remains fully functional for as long as you need it—no lockouts, just freedom to use your version.

Chevereto Lite sits between Chevereto Pro and Chevereto Free, offering features that expand on the free edition's capabilities while keeping things simple:

* **Multi-user support:** Manage multiple users with configurable roles and guest access.
* **Moderation tools:** Approve uploads before they appear in public listings.
* **Followers:** Let users follow each other and build a community.
* **Likes:** Add an additional classification layer with user feedback on uploads.
* **OAuth2 login providers:** Simplify login with services like Google, Discord, Amazon, and more.
* **Custom homepage:** Configure your own landing page for your site.
* **Pages:** Add and manage additional pages for FAQs, About, or custom content.

Chevereto Lite is the perfect next step for those using the free edition, adding features that make multi-user setups, community building, and site management easy.
