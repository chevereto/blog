This is the issue #22 of Chevereto Tiempos, the recap for Chevereto updates delivered by its own creator [Rodolfo Berrios](https://rodolfoberrios.com).

## 🚀 Chevereto v4.0.11 released

On 02/19 I [announced](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/chevereto-v4-0-11-annoncement.15317/) the work in progress for Chevereto 4.0.11.

Patch version 4.0.11 delivers all-new one-click upgrade system,  enabling to keep your Chevereto updated with ease, without needing to enter your server.

Review [Chevereto 4.0.11](https://releases.chevereto.com/4.X/4.0/4.0.11) release notes for a quick summary.

## 🌱 Chevereto Subscription

On 02/01 I [announced](https://blog.chevereto.com/2024/02/01/chevereto-subscription/) that Chevereto changed to a subscription model.

The change to subscription aims for building more software and to keep Chevereto relevant. It compromises the investment required for building the next major releases.

## 🌠 User-based API announced

On 02/02 I [announced](https://blog.chevereto.com/upcoming/user-based-api/) that from `4.1.0` will be rolling the user-based API.

For this development stage I will be progressively delivering the feature and that's why it says "rolling". It means that with every `4.1.x` patch version there will be little additions to the API.

## 🔑 License key regeneration

On 02/03 I [announced](https://blog.chevereto.com/2024/02/03/license-key-regeneration/) that Chevereto customers can now re-generate license keys on the fly.

This is for security, it enables to protect the license in the event the key gets compromised.

## 🐋 Chevereto at Docker Hub

On 02/26 I [announced](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/chevereto-now-available-at-docker-hub.15324/) that Chevereto is now available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/chevereto/chevereto).

This means you can use `chevereto/chevereto` to refer to Chevereto container image, it also offers a different experience compared with the [GHCR package](https://github.com/chevereto/chevereto/pkgs/container/chevereto).

We need your feedback regarding the need for a private container registry where we can enable clients to access Chevereto (paid edition) container images.

## 📦 Chevereto v4 on Vultr Marketplace

On 02/27 I [announced](https://chevereto.com/community/threads/chevereto-v4-now-available-at-vultr-marketplace.15328/) that Chevereto v4 is now available at [Vultr marketplace](https://chevereto.com/go/vultr).

Vultr has been supportive with Chevereto and this upgrade was pending. Now you can spawn Chevereto (newer version) instances one-click away, ready to go.
