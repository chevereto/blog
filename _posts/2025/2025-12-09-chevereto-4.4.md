[Chevereto 4.4 (Vivaracho)](https://v4-docs.chevereto.com/introduction/changelog/4.4.html) evolves the software into a full-fledged service platform, now supporting multitenancy and dynamic provisioning. We are also adding more features and improving security.

The release name, taken from the Spanish word "[Vivaracho](https://dle.rae.es/vivaracho)", continues the tradition of unique code-names following "Macanudo" (4.0), "Pulento" (4.1), "Regio" (4.2), and "Entrador" (4.3). It reflects the spirit of being lively and cheerful.

## Multitenancy support

As announced, Chevereto now fully supports multitenancy. To get started, check out the [multitenancy documentation](https://v4-docs.chevereto.com/application/configuration/multitenancy.html). We also recommend exploring the [Tenants API](https://v4-docs.chevereto.com/api/4/tenants.html) and the [Tenants CLI](https://v4-docs.chevereto.com/application/reference/cli.html#tenants-cli) for managing tenants programmatically.

Multitenancy lets a single system host multiple isolated instances. That means you don't need dozens of separate installations to serve different clients, teams, or communities. It lowers operational costs and opens possibilities for running Chevereto as a hosted service.

For agencies, companies, community operators, or just curious self-hosters, this is a game-changer. You can now:

* Run client-specific media hubs
* Build private internal media libraries
* Launch subscription-based platforms
* Manage multiple communities under one installation
* Offer niche hosting services for creators

Multitenancy lets you treat Chevereto as a platform, not just a single installation. You can experiment with business models, scale your services, and keep infrastructure costs manageable.

## Multi-user is core functionality

Multi-user support, previously available only in paid editions, is now included in all editions. This means any installation can create and manage multiple user accounts without additional costs, making collaboration and shared gallery management accessible to everyone.

## AWS S3 and S3-Compatible Storage APIs are core functionality

The S3 and S3-compatible storage integration (previously restricted behind a paid license tier) is now available to all users as a core feature. This gives you far more freedom in how you deploy and scale your installation, enabling use of Amazon S3, Cloudflare R2, Backblaze B2, Garage, MinIO and any other compatible service.

By removing the paywall, we're making it easier for you to switch between self-hosted and Cloud setups without being tied to a specific license. This change reinforces our commitment to openness, portability, and letting you run Chevereto on your own terms with zero vendor lock-in.

## Security

Chevereto 4.4 strengthens security across the board. Login cookies now track the last seen time, tokens and uploads are protected with HMAC signatures, and sensitive system variables can be encrypted. Web installations are disabled in service contexts to reduce exposure, and password storage has been upgraded to use the more secure Argon2id hashing algorithm.

## CLI

A new `stats-rebuild` command has been added, while the existing `metrics` and `update` commands have been renamed to `stats` and `database-migrate` respectively, making the CLI more intuitive and easier to use.

## Added `/powered-by` Route

Chevereto 4.4 introduces a new `/powered-by` route for legal and informational purposes. In the free edition, it highlights the AGPLv3 licensing scope, while in SaaS setups, it displays the provider information. In all cases, it clearly indicates that Chevereto powers the website and explains what that entails.

## System

Chevereto 4.4 includes several important system improvements. Bugs affecting albums created by guests and invalid file checksum uploads have been fixed, and the `images_hash` table has been merged into the main `images` table, simplifying the database structure.
