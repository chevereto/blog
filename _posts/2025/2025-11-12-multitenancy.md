The [multitenancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy) feature is a major step forward for Chevereto, designed to enable users to create and manage multiple independent sites from a single Chevereto installation. This makes Chevereto the perfect platform for developers, organizations, and businesses that need to host multiple brands or communities efficiently.

Multitenancy will be available as a core Chevereto feature for all editions, without any extra cost. We believe in empowering our users, and we are updating our [license](https://chevereto.com/license) to explicitly grant the right for commercial use.

We have diligently designed a robust, user-friendly multitenancy system, fully integrated into Chevereto and extensively documented. You can find all the details in the [Multitenancy documentation](https://v4-docs.chevereto.com/application/configuration/multitenancy.html).

## How it works

The multitenancy feature allows administrators to create separate "tenants" within a single Chevereto installation. Each tenant operates as an independent site, with its own settings, users, and media. This means you can create multiple Chevereto-powered sites without the need for separate installations. Tenants share the same application codebase and database schema, but their data and configurations remain completely isolated. This makes the deployment of new websites instant and cost-effective, perfect for mass distribution and resellers.

The system is customizable and flexible, with support for defining tenant plans and granular control over the features available to each tenant. This allows administrators to offer different levels of service to each tenant, such as storage limits, user permissions, and feature access.

As Chevereto provides extensive [environment variable](https://v4-docs.chevereto.com/application/configuration/environment.html) configuration, it enables the creation of tailored solutions for diverse use cases and niches, addressing needs that go beyond traditional media hosting.

## Become a service provider

We want to foster and encourage the creation of a new wave of media hosting service providers. We don’t like the idea of a few big players controlling the media hosting landscape, blocking access to entire countries, or censoring content arbitrarily. We believe in the open web, with more choices, decentralization, and diversity. Chevereto multitenancy empowers individuals and teams to create alternative media hosting platforms, free from the limitations of centralized, ad-driven ecosystems.

Join us in this mission to democratize media hosting. With Chevereto’s multitenancy feature, you can easily set up your own media hosting service, tailored to your vision and values. Whether you want to create a niche community, a regional service, or a global platform, Chevereto provides the tools and flexibility you need to succeed.

There are no extra fees or royalty payments, you keep 100% of your earnings. You can set your own pricing, policies, and terms of service. You have full control over your platform and your users.
