Chevereto creator [Rodolfo Berríos](https://rodolfoberrios.com) here, sharing the latest updates from Chevereto in this June edition of Tiempos. The year is well underway, and we have a recap to highlight the key developments so far.

## Chevereto v4.3

In May, we released [Chevereto v4.3](https://releases.chevereto.com/4.X/4.3/4.3.0.html), a significant update that introduced the highly anticipated [big file upload](./2025-03-02-big-file-upload.md) feature, allowing users to upload and share media without size limitations. This enhancement significantly improves the media hosting experience for video files, large images (such as panoramas and 360° photos), and other media types that require substantial storage space.

The release also included a new Redis-based application cache, which dramatically improves load handling and overall performance. "Entrador" is the fastest, most efficient Chevereto yet, and with your feedback, it will continue to get even better.

For a detailed overview of the new features and improvements, check the [release notes](https://releases.chevereto.com/4.X/4.3/4.3.0.html) and the [4.3 Entrador](https://v4-docs.chevereto.com/introduction/changelog/4.3.html) documentation changelog.

## Chevereto Cloud

[Chevereto Cloud](https://chevereto.com/cloud) development is progressing well, with the platform now in private beta. We are working closely with our beta testers to refine the service and ensure a smooth experience for all users. With Chevereto Cloud, we aim to provide a hassle-free hosting solution that allows you to focus on your content without worrying about server management.

We are building everything from the ground up, ensuring that Chevereto Cloud is a robust and reliable platform. We are excited to share more details soon, so stay tuned for updates!
