Chevereto 4.3 (Entrador) introduces several major improvements and new features for enhanced usability, performance, and flexibility.

## Chunked uploads

Large file uploads are now supported through chunked uploading. Files are split into smaller parts and uploaded in parallel, removing previous file size limitations. This enables uploading of large videos, high-resolution images, and other large media without infrastructure constraints. Duplicate detection is performed progressively during upload, and abandoned uploads are automatically cleaned up.

You can offer support for large media uploads without needing to adjust server limits. You can focus on creating and sharing content without technical barriers.

## Performance optimizations

A Redis driver now provides application-layer caching for categories, system variables, tags, guest listings, pages, settings, user albums, and more. Reverse index caching and cache stampede protection are implemented for efficient cache management. The xxh64 checksum algorithm is now used for file hashing, resulting in faster duplicate detection and reduced CPU usage.

Database queries have been optimized, with new composite indexes and fewer round trips. Unused logic and dependencies have been removed, resulting in a cleaner and smaller codebase.

These changes reduce database load, improve response times, and enhance performance under heavy traffic.

## Lossless JPEG handling and metadata control

JPEG uploads are now handled losslessly, with pixel-perfect auto-orientation and optional EXIF data removal for privacy. Images are preserved as uploaded, with no quality loss or hidden compression.

Your uploads with no quality loss, ensuring your photos and artwork are preserved exactly as intended without hidden compression or unwanted changes, making Chevereto ideal for photographers, designers, and anyone needing true-to-source media handling.

## Extended semantics

Custom semantics now extend to files, tags, and video content, allowing for more flexible terminology and behavior to fit different use cases.

This gives you the freedom to tailor Chevereto's language and features to match your community, brand, or workflow. You can rename elements, adjust how content is categorized, and create a more personalized experience for your users, making the platform feel truly your own.

## Security and safer actions

Password recovery and two-factor authentication are now integrated with the request blocking system, providing better protection against brute-force attacks and abuse.

These improvements are crucial because they directly address the growing need for robust security in online platforms. By integrating advanced protection mechanisms, Chevereto helps safeguard user accounts and sensitive data, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and abuse.

## System and UI updates

"Asset storage" is now "Site storage" and "External storage" is now "Upload storage" for improved clarity. The CLI has moved to `app/bin/cli`. Chevereto now supports Cloudflare Turnstile, reCAPTCHA (V2, V3), and hCaptcha for automated abuse protection. UI improvements include palette enforcement, improved listing gaps, and consistent user avatar presentation.

Chevereto 4.3 (Entrador) delivers substantial improvements across performance, usability, and flexibility. We recommend all users review the full changelog and update to benefit from the latest features and optimizations.
